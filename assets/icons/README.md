# App Icons

Place your app icons here:

- `icon.icns` - macOS icon file (required for building)

You can create an .icns file from a PNG using:
- Online tools like https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-icns
- macOS: Use `iconutil` command or tools like Image2icon

For now, electron-builder will use a default icon if this file is missing.
